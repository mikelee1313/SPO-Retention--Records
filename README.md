## üì¶ Prerequisites

### Required Software

- **PowerShell 5.1 or later** (Windows PowerShell or PowerShell 7+)
- **PnP.PowerShell Module** (SharePoint Patterns and Practices PowerShell)

### Required Permissions

- **SharePoint Online Administrator** or **Site Collection Administrator** rights
- **Azure AD App Registration** with:
  - Application permissions: `Sites.FullControl.All`
  - Certificate-based authentication configured

### Installation

1. **Install PnP.PowerShell Module**

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell -Force -AllowClobber
   ```

2. **Set Up Azure AD App Registration**

   - Register an application in Azure AD
   - Grant `Sites.FullControl.All` API permissions
   - Upload a certificate for authentication
   - Note the **Application ID**, **Tenant ID**, and **Certificate Thumbprint**

3. **Download the Script**

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spo-record-unlocker.git
   cd spo-record-unlocker
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Update Script Variables

Edit the script and update these variables in the **USER CONFIGURATION** section:

```powershell
# --- Tenant and App Registration Details ---
$appID = "your-app-id-here"                    # Your Entra App ID
$tenant = "your-tenant-id-here"                # Your Tenant ID
$thumbprint = "your-certificate-thumbprint"    # Certificate thumbprint

# --- Input File Path ---
$sitelist = 'C:\temp\SPOSiteList.txt'         # Path to site URLs file

# --- Lists to Ignore ---
$ignoreListNames = @('Site Assets', 'Site Pages')  # Lists to skip
```

### 2. Create Site List File

Create a text file (e.g., `SPOSiteList.txt`) with one SharePoint site URL per line:

```
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Site1
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Site2
https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Site3
```

### 3. Throttling Configuration (Optional)

Adjust throttling settings based on your environment size:

```powershell
# --- Throttling Protection Settings ---
$DelayBetweenItems = 100        # Delay between items (ms)
$DelayBetweenLists = 500        # Delay between lists (ms)
$DelayBetweenSites = 1000       # Delay between sites (ms)
$MaxRetryAttempts = 5           # Max retry attempts
$BaseRetryDelay = 5000          # Base retry delay (ms)
```

**For larger environments**: Increase delays (e.g., 200ms, 1000ms, 2000ms)  
**For smaller environments**: Decrease delays for faster processing

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

```powershell
.\unlock-listitem.ps1
```

### Verbose Mode (Debugging)

```powershell
.\unlock-listitem.ps1 -Verbose
```

Verbose mode displays:
- All compliance flag values
- Items that don't need unlocking
- Additional diagnostic information

### Example Output

```
Starting to process 3 SharePoint sites...
Log file location: C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\Unlock_Record_Items_2025-10-21_14-30-45_logfile.log

## üîç Understanding Compliance Flags

The script identifies locked items using the `_ComplianceFlags` field:

| Flag Value | Status | Action |
|------------|--------|--------|
| `null` or `0` | No compliance label | Skip (no action needed) |
| `7` | Locked for the first time | **Unlock** |
| `519` | Locked/relocked | **Unlock** |
| `771` | Already unlocked | Skip (no action needed) |
| Other | Unknown status | Log as warning |

### How It Works

1. The script retrieves the `_ComplianceFlags` value for each item
2. Items with flags `7` or `519` are identified as locked
3. The script calls the SharePoint REST API to unlock these items
4. Success/failure is logged for audit purposes

## üõ°Ô∏è Throttling Protection

This script implements [Microsoft's official throttling guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/how-to-avoid-getting-throttled-or-blocked-in-sharepoint-online) to ensure reliable operation in large environments.

### Protection Features

1. **Retry-After Header Handling**
   - Automatically detects HTTP 429 and 503 responses
   - Honors the `Retry-After` header from SharePoint
   - Waits the exact time specified before retrying

2. **Exponential Backoff**
   - If no Retry-After header is provided
   - Uses exponential backoff: 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s
   - Prevents overwhelming SharePoint with retries

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configurable delays between items, lists, and sites
   - Prevents hitting rate limits in the first place
   - Recommended for environments with thousands of items

4. **Automatic Retry**
   - Up to 5 retry attempts by default
   - Only retries on throttling errors (429, 503)
   - Other errors fail immediately

### Adjusting for Your Environment

**Small environment (< 1,000 items)**:
```powershell
$DelayBetweenItems = 50
$DelayBetweenLists = 250
$DelayBetweenSites = 500
```

**Medium environment (1,000 - 10,000 items)**:
```powershell
$DelayBetweenItems = 100   # Default
$DelayBetweenLists = 500   # Default
$DelayBetweenSites = 1000  # Default
```

**Large environment (> 10,000 items)**:
```powershell
$DelayBetweenItems = 200
$DelayBetweenLists = 1000
$DelayBetweenSites = 2000
```

## üìä Logging

### Log File Location

Logs are saved to: `%TEMP%\Unlock_Record_Items_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_logfile.log`

Example: `C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Temp\Unlock_Record_Items_2025-10-21_14-30-45_logfile.log`

### Log Levels

- **INFO**: General information (connections, disconnections)
- **SUCCESS**: Successful operations (unlocked items)
- **WARNING**: Expected findings (locked items found, throttling events)
- **ERROR**: Actual errors (connection failures, API errors)
- **VERBOSE**: Detailed debugging information (only when -Verbose is used)

### Sample Log Entry

```
[2025-10-21 14:30:45] [INFO] === UNLOCK RECORD ITEMS SCRIPT STARTED ===
[2025-10-21 14:30:45] [INFO] Log file: C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Temp\...
[2025-10-21 14:30:46] [SUCCESS] Successfully connected to site: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Site1

```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Failures

**Error**: "Connect-PnPOnline: Access denied"

**Solution**:
- Verify your App ID, Tenant ID, and Certificate Thumbprint are correct
- Ensure the certificate is installed in the Current User certificate store
- Verify the app has `Sites.FullControl.All` permissions
- Check that admin consent has been granted for the permissions

#### 2. Throttling (429/503 Errors)

**Error**: "Throttled (HTTP 429). Waiting X seconds..."

**Solution**:
- This is expected and handled automatically
- If it happens frequently, increase delay values
- Consider running the script during off-peak hours
- The script will automatically retry

#### 3. Module Not Found

**Error**: "The term 'Connect-PnPOnline' is not recognized..."

**Solution**:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell -Force -AllowClobber
Import-Module PnP.PowerShell
```

#### 4. Permission Denied to Unlock Items

**Error**: "REST API unlock failed for item..."

**Solution**:
- Ensure the app has `Sites.FullControl.All` permissions
- Verify you're a Site Collection Administrator
- Some items may have additional restrictions that prevent unlocking

#### 5. Site List File Not Found

**Error**: "Input file not found: C:\temp\SPOSiteList.txt"

**Solution**:
- Create the file at the specified path
- Or update `$sitelist` variable to point to your file location

### Debugging Tips

1. **Use Verbose Mode**
   ```powershell
   .\unlock-listitem.ps1 -Verbose
   ```

2. **Check the Log File**
   - Log file path is shown at script start
   - Contains detailed information about all operations

3. **Test with a Single Site First**
   - Create a test site list with just one site
   - Verify the script works before processing all sites

4. **Uncomment Debug Output**
   - Find this line in the script:
     ```powershell
     # Write-HostAndLog "      ‚Üí Item $itemDisplayName has no compliance label or is already unlocked..."
     ```
   - Remove the `#` to see all items being processed

## üìù Best Practices

### Before Running

1. **Test in a non-production environment first**
2. **Backup your compliance labels and policies**
3. **Create a small test site list** to verify functionality
4. **Run with -Verbose** on a test site to understand the output
5. **Review the log file** after test runs

### During Execution

1. **Monitor the console output** for errors
2. **Don't interrupt the script** during processing
3. **Allow throttling protection to work** - be patient
4. **Watch for consistent errors** that might indicate a configuration issue

### After Running

1. **Review the log file** for any errors or warnings
2. **Verify items were unlocked** in SharePoint
3. **Document the results** (sites processed, items unlocked)
4. **Archive the log file** for compliance/audit purposes

### Performance Tips

1. **Run during off-peak hours** for better performance
2. **Adjust throttling delays** based on your environment
3. **Process sites in batches** if you have hundreds of sites
4. **Use filtering** to skip lists that don't contain records

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Certificate Storage**: Store certificates securely in the certificate store
2. **App Registration**: Use least-privilege principle (only grant necessary permissions)
3. **Credential Management**: Never hardcode passwords; use certificate authentication
4. **Audit Logging**: Retain log files for compliance and audit purposes
5. **Access Control**: Limit who can run this script in production
